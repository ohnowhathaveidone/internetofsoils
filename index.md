# Welcome!

Welcome to the Internet of Soils project page!

This project aims to develop low cost sensor nodes for long-term monitoring of soil moisture. We want to provide an open source design that will allow you to build your own nodes and to modify them to your own needs. Our primary focus are soils in protection forests, but (as long as it's legal and you don't hurt anyone) you are free to stick a sensor wherever you like.

## Project status & Roadmap

We deployed an alpha version of our sensor at a site in Zollikofen (CH-BE). [Here](http://86.119.41.87:3000/dashboard/snapshot/6U7bzUOIN1Sz8jtWq3N0pNmtaTdS7YJt) you can see a sample of the data we record.

We are currently in the process of revising the hardware design of the sensor node. In the next months, we will deploy several (beta version) nodes at a protection forest site around Martigny (CH-VS). At the same time, detailed plans and source code will be made publicly available. If you want to stay up to date on the progress, check back here or leave your email address [below](#get-updates).
