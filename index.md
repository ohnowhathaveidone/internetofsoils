# Welcome!

Welcome to the Internet of Soils project page!

This project aims to develop low cost sensor nodes for long-term monitoring of soil moisture. We want to provide an open source design that will allow you to build your own nodes and to modify them to your own needs. Our primary focus are soils in protection forests, but (as long as it's legal and you don't hurt anyone) you are free to stick a sensor wherever you like.

## Project status

We deployed an alpah version of our sensor and are currently in the process of revising the design. Check back for updates!

[Here](http://86.119.41.87:3000/dashboard/snapshot/09Tbp4CK9fNlcNbqSsvg8HvJWb97OphB) you can see a sample of the data we record.
